# looking healthy:
#
#   verify    are the streams joinable and do the axes actually diverge?
#   resample  can the four streams be put on one 10 Hz grid within tolerance?
#   cmi       does the instruction still explain the action once you can see?
#   package   the 10 Hz subset, ~30% of the bytes, for the GPU box
#
# The resample step is the slow one (a few minutes per hundred episodes) and the
# only one that writes into the session directories.
