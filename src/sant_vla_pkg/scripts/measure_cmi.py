"""Conditional mutual information: does the sentence still matter once you can see?

The last unmeasured item in GATE G2, and the one that most directly states the
claim. Every other number compares whole trajectories. This one asks the question
a policy actually faces, one frame at a time:

    Standing HERE, seeing THIS, how much does the instruction tell me about what
    to do next?

    I(action ; instruction | observation)

If it is near zero, the observation already determines the action and language is
decoration — which is precisely the old stack's failure. `navigator_node` emitted
a lane name; steering came from the camera spline; a goal-shuffle ablation moved
the commanded yaw rate by 0.0049 rad/s. A policy trained on that learns to ignore
the sentence, and no amount of model capacity fixes it.

Conditioning is the whole point
-------------------------------
Plain I(action ; instruction) is easy to inflate and means little: bay1 and bay4
episodes differ in where they end, so their actions differ, so the mutual
information is large — but an observation-only policy would score just as well by
looking out of the window. Conditioning on the observation removes exactly that.
What survives is the part of the action that the sentence explains **and the view
does not**.

The observation bucket
----------------------
Ideally the conditioning variable is the image. Here it is the ground-truth pose,
quantized. That is a *stronger* test than bucketing on pixels: pose determines the
rendered view exactly (static world, no traffic), so two samples in one bucket
have identical images by construction, while an image-feature bucket would blur
together views that merely look similar and leak some position information into
the "unexplained" residual.

Buckets are (x, y, heading) at `--pos-q` metres and `--yaw-q` degrees. A bucket
with samples from only one instruction contributes nothing and is dropped: with
one value of the conditioning variable there is no comparison to make. The number
of usable buckets is reported, because a large CMI over four buckets is not
evidence of anything.

Estimator
---------
Discrete plug-in, on quantized actions. Plug-in MI is biased upward when bins
outnumber samples, so this reports the Miller-Madow correction alongside the raw
value, and a shuffled control: instruction labels permuted **within each bucket**,
which destroys the real association while preserving every marginal. The shuffled
score is the floor this estimator produces from noise alone; the real number has
to clear it to mean anything.
