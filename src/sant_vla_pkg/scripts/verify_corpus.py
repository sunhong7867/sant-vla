"""Acceptance gate for a collection session: did it produce what it claims to?

A collection run that finishes without errors has proved only that it finished.
The properties the corpus is *for* — that trajectories inside a group diverge on
instruction alone, that streams are joinable, that the language axis is balanced
— are none of them checked by the driver, and every one of them has failed
silently at least once in this project's history:

* the aisle sharing broke to a single point and nothing reported it
  (docs/ver/20260728_1906 section 4.1)
* every pose timestamp was 0.0 while the frame counts looked healthy
  (docs/ver/20260728_1713)
* two recorders wrote one session and both episodes had plausible meta.json
  (docs/ver, first collection smoke test)

So this reads the session back off disk and checks it, and exits non-zero if a
gate fails. Run it after every collection, before resampling.

                  above the G1 reset floor and share a real prefix first
