"""Extract driveable centrelines from the track texture into world coordinates.

The oracle has to steer for itself — that is the whole point of replacing the
lane follower, which steers identically no matter which goal was asked for. To
steer it needs a path, and hand-authoring one around a 150 m ring is both tedious
and a source of silent error. The texture already contains the geometry; this
reads it out.

Two things make it reliable rather than a guess:

* **The image-to-world map is verified, not assumed.** ``track.world`` puts the
  ground plane at yaw 1.57, so the plane's local x maps to world +y and local y
  to world -x, over 58.1364 x 43.71084 m. Projecting all 15 zones through it
  lands the 8 ring zones on dark asphalt and the 7 parking-area zones on grey,
  15/15. (Note the size in ``models/race_track/model.sdf`` is *not* the one in
  effect; the world file carries its own.)
* **The centreline comes from the two ring boundaries, not from thinning.**
  Neither ``cv2.ximgproc`` nor ``skimage`` is installed. A distance-transform
  ridge was tried first and failed badly — with a 5x5 maximum filter the ridge
  is a noisy plateau rather than a one-pixel line, and a greedy walk over it
  connected 33 of 3084 points. The road is an annulus, so it has exactly one
  outer contour and one hole; pairing each outer point with its nearest inner
  point and taking the midpoint is both simpler and robust to the S-curve at the
  bottom, where a radial parameterisation would cross the band twice.
