"""Corpus collection driver: enumerate a grid, reset, command, record, label.

This is the piece that turns the oracle into a dataset. Everything before it
proved that a *pair* of episodes can be made to diverge on instruction alone
(docs/ver/20260728_1906). This drives that pairing thousands of times and writes
down which episodes belong to which comparison, at collection time, because that
bookkeeping cannot be reconstructed afterwards.

Structure
---------
The unit of collection is a **counterfactual group**: one start pose, several
instructions. Every episode in a group is reset to the *same* pose, so any
trajectory difference inside a group is attributable to the sentence and nothing
else. Groups get a ``cf_group_id``; episodes inside get a ``cf_variant_id``.

    group g0007  start (-11.3, -19.4, 178.4 deg)
      v0  "Park in the second bay on the right, slowly."      bay2 / 0.7
      v1  "Take the fourth bay, quickly."                      bay4 / 1.8
      v2  "Pull into the first parking space, steadily."       bay1 / 1.2
      ...

Three things this driver does that a naive loop would not:

**It varies where the episode starts.** Every group samples a different point
along the ring→aisle connector, with lateral and heading jitter. If every episode
began from an identical pose, "turn right after 4.2 seconds" would be a perfect
policy on the training set and useless anywhere else. The jitter also supplies
the recovery behaviour a pure-pursuit demonstrator otherwise never shows: from an
offset start the oracle must steer back, and those frames are the only place the
corpus contains a correction.

**It shuffles variant order inside a group.** Anything that drifts over a long
session — physics state, disk pressure, thermal — would otherwise correlate with
bay index and enter the corpus as a confound that looks like signal.

**It records why an episode failed.** The recorder's ``termination`` field is
six-valued for this reason. An episode that timed out is not an episode that
succeeded, and a session where 5% time out is a different dataset from one where
0% do. Outcomes land in ``manifest.jsonl`` next to the plan, so a run that is
killed halfway is still interpretable.

Group completeness matters more than episode count: a group missing one variant
contributes no pair for that comparison. The summary reports complete groups
separately from total episodes.
