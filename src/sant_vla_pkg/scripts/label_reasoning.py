"""Offline reasoning-label generator for packed v3y episodes.

For every frame of a packed episode (``meta.json`` + ``resampled_10hz.jsonl``)
this derives a *fact skeleton* purely from recorded ground truth — pose,
speed, the 30-step action window, and the track/zone config — and composes a
deterministic English sentence describing why the vehicle is doing what it is
doing. No model, no ROS, no image is involved: every claim is checkable
against the sim state, which is the whole point (labels a VLM paraphrases
later must stay anchored to these facts).

Facts per frame:
  - curvature class of the ring at the ego (curve / gentle curve / straight)
  - arc-length distance ALONG THE INSTRUCTED LANE to the goal zone
    (Euclidean is wrong on this compact ring — see chat_gui_node._arc_ahead)
  - nearest zone within 8 m (context even without a goal)
  - measured speed, planned end-of-chunk speed, and the accel/decel/hold
    trend (thresholds shared with vla_narrator)
  - net planned yaw over the chunk -> turning left / right
  - instruction context: goal, lane, commanded speed tier

Adjacent frames share an event, so sentences are generated per *segment*
(a maximal run of frames whose discrete facts agree) and frames link to the
segment. Numbers in the sentence are frozen at segment start; the per-frame
facts keep the exact values.

Output: ``reasoning.jsonl`` sidecar in each episode dir (originals are never
touched). First line is an episode header with the segment table; following
lines are ``{"k", "segment_id", "facts", "skeleton"}`` per frame.
