"""Closed-loop serving bridge: the only thing that touches /cmd_vel during eval.

Two processes, on purpose. ROS2 Jazzy runs on the system Python 3.12 with apt
numpy/opencv; lerobot brings its own torch/transformers/av. Mixing them has cost
this project a day before. So the policy lives behind ZMQ
(``scripts/vla_policy_server.py`` or any stand-in speaking the same contract) and
this node stays pure rclpy.

Wire contract (msgpack over ZMQ REQ/REP)::

    ->  {"jpeg": bytes, "state": [3]f32, "task": str, "seed": int, "req": int}
    <-  {"actions": [[dx, dy, dyaw], ...]}        # CHUNK_LEN rows, ego-frame SE(2)

`seed` travels explicitly because `D_same` — the reproducibility floor every
divergence number is divided by — is only measurable if the sampler can be pinned
from the caller.

Threading
---------
Four callback slots, and the split is load-bearing:

* **sensor** (Reentrant) — image and odom callbacks write into a mutex-guarded
  `LatestObservation`. No encoding, no torch, no blocking.
* **control** (MutuallyExclusive, 10 Hz) — pops one action and publishes. Runs in
  microseconds and never touches the network. If inference were called from here,
  a 50 ms round trip would eat half the control period.
* **instruction** — `/vla/instruction`, RELIABLE + TRANSIENT_LOCAL depth 1, so an
  eval harness that attaches after the instruction was sent still sees it.
* **a plain thread outside the executor** — issues inference whenever the queue
  falls below `refill_at`. This is the only place that blocks.

Chunk splicing
--------------
New chunks are blended into the overlapping tail of the queue with a linear ramp.
Without it the command jumps at every chunk boundary, which shows up as a steering
twitch every `chunk_len` ticks and inflates the `D_same` noise floor — the
denominator of the whole evaluation.

Rules in the control path
-------------------------
Exactly one, and it is instrumented: if the queue underruns or the newest chunk
is older than its configured horizon, command zero linear and angular velocity.
Every activation is counted and published. **A valid eval run is watchdog
activations == 0 and underrun < 1%**;
both numbers are reported with every result. Stopping at a goal is *not* a rule
here — it has to be learned behaviour, present in the demonstrations as a
deceleration ramp.
